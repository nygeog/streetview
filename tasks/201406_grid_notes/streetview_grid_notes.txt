Streetview file updates:

1) Add Corpus Christi
	meaning we now have 
	M1. New York City/Newark
	M2. Detroit
	M3. San Jose
	M4. Philadelphia
	M5. Corpus Christi

2) Compare counts of FF in municipal boundaries versus CSA's as well as the number of grids


3) Grids:

from now on I'll refer to them in meters (0500 - 0.5 km, 1000 - 1 km, 2000 - 2 km)

0500 m grid FF respondents KD test different values 0.85-1 at .05 incriments - counts of both the respondents and the # of grid points
	Table of KD's for each city
	KD value 	FF points	0.5 km grid points
	0.85
	0.90
	0.95
	1.00


1000 m grid
Population Density Quartiles (based on Metro Area, not just city):

Top Quartile - 1 km grid (top 25% density)
2nd Quartile - 2 km grid
3rd Quartile - 2 km grid
4th Quartile - 2 km grid

2000 m grid


MENTION THAT I REMOVED A NAT'L LEVEL WATERSET



Bader:


philadelphia centriods of all street blocks - might need to check with philly GIS




projection to be same projection for streets WGS_84 (?)


not in lat/long but meters from some standard reference point
UTM

streetview grid needs to be sent not in lat/long but meters (UTM?)


what we need is do you know anything about krigging, what we wannna do is find some way for steve to pass me the points at which the streetview actually occurred. i gave steve a point, some matched, soem didnt some matched off by a certian threshold, so steve needs to send me these points. From that, what we need is a database of lats and longs, projection in a linear unit, (UTM or a State Plane). State Plane (find a state Plane layer) in addition for points observed....to create grid for krigging. 

create census block centroids as our mesh. X,Y's and send to Bader,Steve

MatLab

Output
Steves stuff in State Plane
census block centroids in state plane 

create city plus a buffer for the blocks 5 km buffer, indicate which kilometer distance it falls in. distance from city. for the centroid. 

2010 block boundaries


later:
intersect the fragile families locations and aggregate within the buffers.
